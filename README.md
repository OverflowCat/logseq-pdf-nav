# Logseq PDF Navigation

This is a plugin that helps you navigate through a PDF document in Logseq when there are internal links. Jumping back to where you click the link is painful; this plugin adds button to the PDF toolbar, which provides go back and forward functionality.

## Known Issues

* Please first close the previous document if you want to open another one. (will fix later)

* If the buttons do not appear, please close and re-open it, for the first time of loading a PDF may be slow.
